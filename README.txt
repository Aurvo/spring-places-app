A small Maven/Spring app showcasing some core features of Spring.

Like a Todo app, but you add locations (Places) instead of work items.

Includes:
	- login and authentication via Spring Security
	- image uploading
	- Controllers (of course)
	- Spring services
	- some bootstrap styling with a navbar and icons
	- and more
	
Tested using Tomcat7 as the server.
	
New Places are stored in memory and do not persist across multiple
application runs. This was meant to be more of a showcase than a
practical app.
